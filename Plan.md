# Planning Document.

Use this document to start outlining how you will write your program. What kind of variables, conditionals, and Boolean statements will you need?

I'll need variables for the colors and shapes of the turtles, as well as for the starting coordinates of the turtles. For loops indicate how many times a loop should run and are used for each run of the turtle. Boolean statements could be used if I chose to stop the movements of the turtles. However in this case, I opted to simply put a specific number of turtles in the list so that it doesn't on an infinite loop.
