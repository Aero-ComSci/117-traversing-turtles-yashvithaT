Follow the instructions on the book

2. Implement by creating a class that contains the following:

Data Structure to store the turtles
Data Structure to store the colors
A public method that contains a loop to iterate through the data structure.
An __str__ method on the class to print out step 6 -- for the turtles, what specific information would be useful?
An __init__ method to set the turtles to the data structure
Be sure include error checks and documentation on the read me to utilize the class you create.
 

3. Action Items

Step 17 Extend your program
Step 18 

## Questions about the Activity as you work. 
```
Is there more than one way to get the program to achieve the task?
Hos could I add complexity to this program?

```
#### Description Of The App 
```
This program utilizes lists to pick specific shapes or colors for the turtles. They move forward and turn based on a certain distance that they were given and everytime another turtle is added, 5 units are added to how much the turtle moves forward. This creates a spiral shape since the distance increases each time. The shape and color change each time and the program maintains complexity as it utilizes a variety of unique colors and shapes.
```
# Include a video of the result of the code at speed 0 or Fast. Be sure to make it available for me to see.
